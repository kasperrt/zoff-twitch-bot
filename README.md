# Zoff twitch-bot

Hi there,

I'm a bot! If you want to use me for listening to Zoff (https://zoff.me) while streaming, and allowing people to request songs through the chat, I'm your guy (or bot).

To have me join your channel, go to (https://bot.zoff.me), and log in there. From there, you can add admin-password, channel-password, and which zoff-channel you want me to fetch data from!

If you don't have an admin-password or channel-password, these can be left blank.

When I'm in your channel, your viewers can type !request YOUTUBE_ID or !request SOUNDCLOUD_LINK to have me add a song to your channel. If they want to check the currently playing song, they can type !np.

If the channel doesn't allow links, to add soundcloud songs you can send "!request /ARTIST/SONG" (sending the text after https://soundcloud.com/).

I also moderate links if you turn me into a moderator, and set me to moderate! Just type !moderate on, and I'll go ahead and moderate. To stop me from moderating, type !moderate off. If you never enabled moderation, you don't have to get me to stop, I never started in the first place! If you want to allow someone to post a link, type !allow USERNAME.

You can also set your current time in GMT, for me to list to your viewers when they type !time. Use this with !settime +AMOUNT or !settime -AMOUNT.

If you're tired of me, you can type !leave in either a Whisper or in my channel to have me leave your channel.

If you want to easily display the currently playing song from your zoff-channel on stream, try the new python program we created! It is located in https://github.com/zoff-music/zoff-twitch-bot/tree/master/assets/program/dist. But if you don't trust .exe's it is just to download the python script itself, at https://github.com/zoff-music/zoff-twitch-bot/blob/master/assets/program/program.py


Happy listening!
