# Zoff twitch-bot

Hi there,

I'm a bot! If you want to use me for listening to Zoff (https://zoff.me) while streaming, and allowing people to request songs through the chat, I'm your guy.

To have me join your channel, send "!join ZOFF_CHANNEL" in the chat here. If you're using any userpasswords or adminpasswords on your Zoff channel, you can send the join command in a Whisper to me. Then send "!join ZOFF_CHANNEL USERPASSWORD ADMINPASSWORD".

If you don't have an adminpassword, you can just leave this blank, but if you have an adminpassword, but not userpassword, you have to enter a dummy-text here, for example "foo".

When I'm in your channel, your viewers can type !request YOUTUBE_ID or !request SOUNDCLOUD_LINK to have me add a song to your channel. If they want to check the currently playing song, they can type !np.

If the channel doesn't allow links, to add soundcloud songs you can send "!request /ARTIST/SONG" (sending the text after https://soundcloud.com/).

I also moderate links if you turn me into a moderator! If you want to allow someone to post a link, type !allow USERNAME.

You can also set your current time in GMT, for me to list to your viewers when they type !time. Use this with !settime +AMOUNT or !settime -AMOUNT.

If you're tired of me, you can type !leave in either a Whisper or in my channel to have me leave your channel.

Happy listening!
